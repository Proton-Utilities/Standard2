# About

S2 (Standard2) is a naming initiative to make custom environments feel more intuitive. The current environment of executors are very inefficient:

- **Automatically added environment standards** - Currently, every available exploit automatically adds functions and libraries to the environment, this behavior is unintuitive, and can lead to unintentional naming conflicts.
- **Various aliases** - Due to the amount of exploits to have come out over several years, variations in naming schemes occur, which creates even more environment clutter, and creates confusion among developers.
- **Incorrect namespacing** - For example, base64 compress/decompress dosen't belong in the crypt library, yet in almost every executor it is. This is just one instance of incompetency which has added up over the years.
